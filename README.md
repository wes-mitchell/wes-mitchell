## Welcome! 👋

### A little about Me
:man_student: I’m currently a full stack web developer student attending Nashville Software School 
working with cohort 55 learning fundamentals in Javascript, HTML, CSS and C# as a back 
end focus language. 

I’d be more than thrilled to collaborate and network with folks who have similar interest. 
Feel free to shoot me a message here or via e-mail listed below. 

🥁 Fun fact: I have performed professionally on the drums in over 10 countries. 🤘
